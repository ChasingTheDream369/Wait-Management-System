# Wait-Management-System

• Created the world’s first Wait Management System for Restaurants by integrating the Point of Sales Report and describing
the problem in detail with suggesting our unique solution to it by implementing stock management, sales report, Advanced
Queue management, Critical Data Visualization, real time-notification management and category sorting.

• Created the schema design using Navicat and then used SQLALchemy with PyMySQL to define the database schema of the
backend to deal with the smooth and efficient storage and retrieval of data. Implemented the server using Flask REST API and
used Flask session and CORS to further deal with the development issues and facilitating user interactions with the system.

• Used Pycryptodome, Hashlib, Crytography to deal with the user login, user registration and logouts.

• Deployed the entire code on Heroku and received the 5th highest score in the course, being the best team in a single tutorial.
